"Thank you for being so open, I'm trying to determine the best way to help and know how hard it is to revisit trauma. I would like to know if Protocol 6 proved too painful for you?",2,2,2,2
"I am sorry this has not made you feel better, somtimes it may be necessary to try different protocols before feeling better. Would you like to attempt another one which hopefully will be much more helpful to you?",2,2,2,2
"Thank you for that, perhaps Protocol 6 could help you deal with this event, however before I can recommend it i'd like to make sure that you haven't had a bad experience with it in the past.
