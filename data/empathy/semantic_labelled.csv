125,您最近是否尝试过方案 6 并因此重温了创伤性事件？,2

128,您最近是否尝试过考虑此事件，但发现它太痛苦了？,2
129,你是否尝试过协议 6，如果是，你是否对过去有消极的想法，导致你的思绪在那个方向徘徊？,2

132,如果您最近尝试了协议 6 并发现由于旧事件而重新点燃无法控制的情绪，您能否告诉我？,2
133,好的，谢谢你。您最近是否尝试过协议 6，它是否会导致重温痛苦的情绪？,2

1191,好的，有道理，谢谢你告诉我。这个事件是不久前发生的，还是最近发生的？,1
1192,这是因为最近发生的事情，还是因为你想起了更遥远的过去？,1
1193,我很抱歉发生在你身上，很难经历一些痛苦的事情。这是最近发生的还是前一段时间发生的？,1
1194,我希望你能谈论它。这是最近引起您焦虑的事情还是过去很遥远的事情？,1
1195,我明白了，谢谢你澄清这一点。我想知道，这个事件是最近发生的，还是更远的过去？,1
1196,我在这儿陪你。这是什么时候发生的，最近还是在更远的过去？,1

1200,我想知道，您是否认为尝试使用协议 6 来重温事件，如果您这样做了，可能会导致这种感觉吗？,2
1201,我知道这件事让你很痛苦。你最近有没有重温这个事件，试图找到它的结局，但它所做的只是把你在事件中无法忍受的情绪带回来？,2
1202,您可能知道，协议 6 可用于检查此类事件。您有使用协议 6 的经验吗？而且，如果是这样，您是否发现它使与过去事件相关的困难情绪浮出水面？,2
1203,您最近是否通过协议 6 重新审视了该事件的创伤，这就是您现在感到焦虑的原因吗？,2
1204,有时它可以帮助通过协议 6 解决与过去的创伤事件相关的焦虑。你是否已经尝试过协议 6，如果是的话，你是否真的发现它带来的情绪过于强烈？,2
1205,你最近是否通过协议 6 重新审视了这个事件，并发现它带回了焦虑的感觉和情绪？,2
1206,感到焦虑和完全可以理解是可以的。我只需要知道您最近是否试图回忆过去的事件并发现它令人痛苦？,2

1208,有时人们在尝试协议 6 时可能会受到不利影响。您最近是否尝试过使用协议 6 并发现这种体验令人痛苦？,2
1209,您最近是否尝试过协议 6 并发现您发现的情绪难以处理？,2
1210,我知道你过去发生的事情会带来强烈的情绪。是否因为尝试执行协议 6 而重新点燃了这些感觉？,2
1211,在某些情况下，协议 6 可用于回顾特别创伤性事件，但这有时会引发麻烦的情绪反应。你之前有没有使用过协议6，它有没有让你有任何无法控制的情绪？,2
1212,我想知道现在是否有什么东西重新点燃了这种感觉。您是否尝试过记住或重温此事件并因此感到焦虑？,2
1213,通过尝试协议 6 来重温创伤性事件会带来消极和无法控制的情绪。您是否尝试通过执行协议 6 重新审视该事件并因此感到不舒服？,2

1218,你是否已经尝试过重新审视这个事件却发现这样做会带来强烈的负面情绪？,2
1219,我明白你为什么会感到焦虑。你认为尝试协议 6 会重新点燃这些难以控制的情绪吗？,2
1220,你最近有没有尝试过协议 6 并发现它把所有那些不好的感觉都带回来了？,2
1221,我意识到克服过去的消极想法可能很困难。最近尝试协议 6 是否让您回忆起这个事件，从而使您记忆犹新，并让您感到焦虑？,2
1222,协议 6 可能会有很大帮助，但我知道它有时也会引起不必要的压力。您最近是否尝试过协议 6，并在使用后发现自己太苦恼了？,2
1223,协议 6 有时会对人们产生相当负面的影响。您是否尝试过协议 6，它是否对您产生了负面影响？,2
1224,我知道这很难，所以感谢您与我分享。如果你尝试过协议 6，是否会重新点燃你这种不好的感觉？,2
1225,您是否尝试过协议 6 并且感觉过于强烈？,2
1226,处理过去的创伤真的很艰难，我很欣赏你的勇气。请问您是否尝试过协议6，但发现它太难了？,2
1227,您是否尝试过协议 6 并发现它没有一个好的结果？,2
1228,我知道协议 6 通常会触发对过去的创伤事件重新产生焦虑感，所以在我推荐它之前，我想知道这是否发生在你身上。协议 6 是您最近尝试过的并且让您感到焦虑的东西吗？,2
1229,你有没有尝试过协议 6，当你回忆过去的事情时，它有没有让你有任何不好的感觉？,2
1230,有时，当我们通过某些协议并发现，正如我们所做的那样，这些协议可以揭示负面情绪和体验。你有没有尝试过协议 6 但发现它太令人痛苦了？,2
1231,协议 6 确实可以唤起回忆，这取决于情况的好坏。您是否尝试过协议 6，它是否对您产生了负面影响？,2
1232,您是否已经尝试过协议 6，但发现它不但没有缓解您的焦虑，反而使情况变得更糟？,2
1233,这些情绪是不是因为你偶然尝试了协议 6 而重新点燃了？,2
1234,很好，我相信你对协议 6 很熟悉。你最近有没有尝试过协议 6，如果有，当你想到这些过去的事件时，你是否觉得这带来了一些难以处理的感觉?,2
1235,处理过去发生的事情可能很困难。你是否已经尝试过协议 6 来重新审视这个事件，但发现它太难和痛苦了？,2

1241,您是否已经尝试回想这件事，如果是这样，是否让您感觉更糟？,2
1242,众所周知，协议 6 会对某些人产生负面影响，如果您最近尝试过，我想知道它是否会导致您目前的情绪。您是否熟悉协议 6，如果熟悉，您是否认为它可能会导致您的焦虑？,2
1243,谢谢，我想将协议 6 作为您的可能建议，但我知道有时和在某些情况下它可能会令人不快。你有没有尝试过协议 6，它对你来说是不是不愉快？,2
1244,我觉得我可以向你建议协议 6 来处理过去的事件，但我想确保它适合你。您过去是否尝试过协议 6 并发现它重新点燃了不舒服的情绪？,2
1245,我可以问一下，想想发生的事情对你来说是不是太痛苦了？,2
1246,协议 6 有时会让人们感到不安，所以我想知道您是否遇到过这种情况。协议 6 是否是您尝试过并因此感到不安的东西？,2
1247,协议 6 可能对您的情况有所帮助，但它并不适合所有人，因此我想了解它是否适​​合您。您是否已经在过去执行了协议 6，并发现它由于旧事件而重新点燃了无法控制的情绪？,2

1418,我知道你现在正在经历一个艰难的时刻，但请让我调查一下，看看是否有更深层次的原因。你认为你可能有试图拯救其他人的倾向吗？,6
1419,很抱歉让您感到焦虑，如果还有其他因素在起作用，我希望尝试更好地理解。你现在的感觉是否是因为相信你应该在他们需要帮助的时候帮助他们？,6
1420,你认为帮助别人是你的责任吗？,6
1421,您是否认为有时您会优先考虑其他人的问题并试图拯救他们而不是处理自己的问题？,6
1422,您是否觉得自己有责任帮助他人？,6
1423,你认为自己是一个同理心的人吗，总是为他人着想对你来说很重要吗？,6
1424,听到您感到焦虑，我很抱歉，我想尝试找出您有这种感觉的原因。你有没有觉得大部分时间你可能把别人放在自己之前？,6
1425,我想让你知道我完全理解这种感觉是什么感觉，我接下来的问题可能会帮助我理解表面之下发生的事情。你认为你可以试图成为别人的救援者吗？,6
1426,我知道您现在感到有些不安和焦虑。你能告诉我更多关于你的感受吗？您是否觉得需要帮助生活中的其他人以使自己感觉更好？,6
1427,你是否觉得你最近有一种强烈的帮助他人的愿望，你可能会过度扩展自己，以至于影响到你自己的生活？,6
1428,你相信你有能力在任何时候拯救每一个人吗？,6
1429,您是否担心并担心让别人更快乐是您的工作？,6
1430,你认为至少你的一些焦虑可能是因为你有责任拯救别人吗？,6
1431,您是否认为您可能正在寻求改变某人而不是专注于自己？,6
1432,我可以理解你现在的感受，并想看看这里是否有更深层次的因素在起作用。你认为自己是那种想要或需要拯救他人的人吗？,6
1433,谢谢你。您是否觉得其他人过于依赖您的支持？,6
1434,是不是您觉得有必要尝试拯救他人，而这可能是您感到焦虑的根源？,6
1435,你有时会觉得你是在试图拯救每个人吗？,6
1436,您是否觉得自己必须成为他人的救星，还是他人总是期待您的帮助？,6
1437,你认为你有什么重要的东西可以提供给别人吗？,6
1438,你觉得你想拯救别人并让他们感觉更好吗？,6
1439,你是不是总觉得必须把别人放在自己之前？,6
1440,我知道您今天感觉不舒服，想进一步调查是什么困扰着您。你有这种感觉是因为你试图帮助你关心的人吗？,6
1441,我真的很想更多地了解你此刻的生活。你是不是总觉得你必须在意或拯救别人？,6
1442,首先，让我告诉你，我完全理解你来自哪里以及拥有这些感觉是什么感觉。我想知道，在你的内心深处，你认为总是把别人放在第一位是合理的还是健康的？,6
1443,您认为其他人会从您的帮助中受益吗？,6
1444,您是否认为有时您可能会觉得有必要帮助某人？,6
1445,在你的生活中，是否有人觉得可能需要你的帮助？,6

1448,您认为是否有任何外部因素可能会影响您的感受，例如其他人的行为、言语或行为？,7
1449,我明白了，谢谢，那么或许我们应该去别处寻找这种焦虑的根源。你会说现在有人在伤害你，强迫你做你不想做的事情或让你受苦吗？,7
1450,谢谢，我现在想关注的是你对这种焦虑的感受。有没有觉得你之所以有这种感觉是因为别人的所作所为？,7
1451,你是否觉得事情不是你的错，你已经做了你能做的，不应该受到责备，但别人是？,7
1452,你会说有人要为你的感受负责吗？,7
1453,你觉得有人要怪你吗？,7
1454,你认为有人会因为你的感受而受到指责吗？,7
1455,在这种情况下，是否更像是一种被其他人做错的感觉，导致了这些消极的想法？,7
1456,您认为其他人的态度和/或行为会影响您的感受吗？,7
1457,谢谢你让我知道。有人对你做了什么吗？,7
1458,谢谢你的回答。你是否觉得有人给你施加了不适当的压力？,7
1459,谢谢，我明白了。在您看来，您是否认为自己会因为自己的感受而责怪他人？,7
1460,谢谢，如果可以的话，我想问一个后续问题。我可以问你是否觉得其他人可能是你消极情绪的原因，而不是你自己的行为或行为？,7
1461,当你情绪低落时，你是否发现自己曾经责怪别人？,7
1462,你可能觉得自己是一个受害者，你是否觉得你的焦虑背后有人？,7
1463,您可能会因为将自己视为受害者而有这种感觉吗？,7
1464,那么这样的话，我想知道，也许你觉得你太依赖别人的认可了。你认为你的负面情绪部分是由他人造成的吗？,7
1465,好的，如果您能与我分享更多信息，我将不胜感激。你可能认为自己是受害者吗？你会因为你的负面情绪而责怪别人吗？,7
1466,你认为你有坏事吗？,7
1467,我想知道你是否觉得别人的行为让你有这种感觉。你会因为你现在的感受而责怪别人吗？,7
1468,没关系，谢谢。你会因为发生在你身上的事情而责怪任何人吗？你认为自己是这一切的受害者吗？,7
1469,我明白。你是否觉得别人有错，就好像他们让你有这种感觉一样？,7
1470,你认为人们对你不公平吗？,7
1471,您是否认为自己可能会无意中发现自己将他人视为消极情绪的来源，并因此而觉得自己是受害者？,7
1472,您是否觉得自己受到了他人行为的负面影响？,7
1473,你会说你的感受是因为别人吗？,7
1474,好吧，这是可以理解的。你觉得别人是你这种感觉的原因吗？,7
1475,好的，让我们进一步探讨一下。你认为你可能会让别人对你对自己的感觉负责，可能将自己视为受害者吗？,7
1476,那就好，谢谢解答。我想问一下，如果您不介意，您是否觉得自己受到了伤害和/或其他人对您的负面情绪负责？,7
1477,你觉得有人可能对你目前的感受负责吗？,7
1478,你认为别人对你的负面情绪有过错吗？,7
1479,你有没有可能觉得别人的行为让你不开心，而不是你自己的过错？,7
1480,好的，谢谢你的回答。你认为你的负面情绪是由别人对你的行为引起的吗？,7
1481,有时我们可能会觉得其他人要为我们的感受负责。您认为现在有人正在引起您的焦虑吗？,7
1482,你是否觉得你现在的感受不应该归咎于你，而某人或某事是原因？,7
1483,谢谢你让我知道。你认为别人的行为让你有这种感觉吗？,7
1484,是不是你觉得你的负面情绪可能要归咎于其他人，这会导致你的焦虑？,7
1485,你是否因为自己的感受而以任何方式责备他人？,7
1486,您是否觉得好像是其他人造成了您的负面情绪？,7
1487,你是否因为你觉得别人对你做过的事情而受伤？,7
1488,你是否觉得别人故意让你感觉不好？,7
1489,最近，你是否觉得人们“想要抓住你”？,7
1490,有没有人伤害过你，或者担心过你，你是否因为他们给你带来了这么多麻烦而对他们感到不安？,7
1491,好的我明白了。您是否在生活中感受到其他人的压力，或以任何方式受到伤害？,7
1492,说别人经常对你的负面情绪和想法负责，你对此有些无能为力，是否公平？,7
1493,其他人可以为你的感受负责吗？,7
1494,你是否有时觉得别人的行为是你感觉的原因？,7
1495,有人为难你吗？,7
1496,你是否发现自己最近总是把你的问题归咎于别人？,7
1497,您个人会认为自己会受到周围其他人的情绪和行为的影响吗？,7
1498,你认为你可能是在试图掌管别人吗？,8
1499,没关系，谢谢你让我知道。难不成你就是想控制别人的人？有时，当我们自己经历痛苦时，我们可能会这样做。,8
1500,谢谢，你可以直接说“不”或“是”，因为这有助于我更清楚地了解你的感受。在你的生活中，是否有一种关系让你试图对他们进行过多的控制？,8
1501,有时我们希望我们可以 24/7 全天候为某人服务，但这也可能变成控制行为。您是否认为您可能对某人表现出控制性行为，或试图接管他们生活的某些方面？,8
1502,您是否担心无法知道或控制其他人将要做什么？,8
1503,您是否觉得需要控制事物或人来帮助缓解焦虑？,8
1504,你是否觉得你可能被视为控制欲强，甚至令人生畏？,8
1505,您是否认为您正试图影响您无法控制的某人或某事？,8
1506,你是否认为也许你是在试图强迫别人？,8
1507,谢谢你。有人没有按照你喜欢的方式做事吗？,8
1508,谢谢你。或许，您是否相信您正在对一个人施加不适当的压力来获得您所需要的结果？,8
1509,您是否认为您可能以某种方式控制或试图控制另一个人？,8
1510,我明白了，谢谢，我还有一个问题想问。你有没有觉得生活中有些事情或人太难以预测了，并希望你能对它们有更多的控制？,8
1511,你有没有觉得你在试图控制别人？,8
1512,您是否有任何想法表明您可能希望对某个人有更多的控制权？,8
1513,我能理解焦虑是什么感觉，有时焦虑会让我们觉得某人没有按照他们应该的方式行事。可能是你试图控制某人，甚至没有意识到吗？,8
1514,你觉得对别人有任何责任吗？你会说你试图过多地影响他们的生活吗？,8
1515,我明白了，谢谢你，让我们继续下一个问题，试图找到你感受的根源。也许你觉得你在试图控制某人？,8
1516,你想从某人身上得到特定的东西吗？,8
1517,是否希望你能影响某人或某事？,8
1518,我很感激你对我敞开心扉。在这一切中，您是否看到自己试图影响或控制他人的行为？,8
1519,我明白。也许您生活中的某个人没有按照您认为的那样行事，而您可能正在鼓励他们改变自己的方式？,8
1520,当有人做了你希望他们不会做的事情时，你真的很生气吗？,8
1521,您认为在管理您的负面情绪时，您是否可能对生活中的某个人表现出控制性行为？,8
1522,您是否认为您可能会试图控制另一个人，无论您是否有意？,8
1523,在你生命的这个阶段，你觉得有必要控制任何人吗？,8
1524,好的，谢谢你。你认为你经常负责生活中的人或事吗？,8
1525,谢谢你和我谈论这个。另一种可能性是，您可能试图控制他人以减少焦虑，您认为情况可能是这样吗？,8
1526,出于某种原因，想要控制生活中的事物或人是很常见的，尤其是当我们正在经历一段艰难的时期并觉得没有任何进展时。你有没有可能试图控制你认识的人？,8
1527,当您应该接受事物的现状并允许事物流动时，您是否觉得您可能正在尝试控制情况的结果？,8
1528,你相信你可以操纵别人吗，即使那不是你的本意？,8
1529,您是否认为您正处于试图影响他人行为方式的位置？,8
1530,您是否可能因为觉得别人做了您应该更多控制的事情而感到焦虑？,8
1531,很难接受我们无法控制他人的想法或行为。你最近有没有发现自己试图控制某人？请放心，我不会因此评判你。,8
1532,您是否觉得您现在可能正在尝试影响生活中的其他人？,8
1533,谢谢，我明白了。您是否发现自己想要引导他人的行为或行动朝着正确的方向发展？,8
1534,谢谢你，我想帮助你感觉好些，因为我知道焦虑很难。您是否有可能试图控制某人，这是否会导致您感到压力很大？,8
1535,你认为你的行为方式有可能被解释为控制吗？,8
1536,你是否感觉好像你需要控制别人，因为你觉得自己失去了控制？,8
1537,你有没有可能强迫别人，也许是你关心的人，按照你想要的方式行事？,8
1538,您最近是否发现自己想要更多地控制他人，或者希望您可以改变他们的行为？,8
1539,您是否觉得对其他人负责，以至于您可能试图改变或纠正他们的行为？,8
1540,也许你是想帮助太多，而这个人不会听你的？,8
1541,您是否正在体验一种控制感，例如想要控制某个情况或某个人？,8
1542,是否可能是您潜意识地试图引导或指导他人的行为？,8
1543,你愿意在人际关系中起带头作用吗？,8
1544,您是否认为有时您会鼓励人们按照您认为应该的方式行事？,8
1545,在不打扰的情况下，我可以问一下你生活中是否有人觉得你的行为不像你希望的那样？,8
1546,您是否认为您可能想要更多地控制其他人，也许是某个因您认为错误的行为而让您感到焦虑的人？,8
1547,你相信你对他人的行为和情绪有很大的影响吗？,8
1548,是否有可能您总是为出错的事情责备自己，即使它们不一定是您的错？,9
1549,我明白了，那很好，谢谢。最近，你是不是总发现事情没有按计划进行时，总是把责任推到自己身上？,9
1550,谢谢，我想再问问你对这种焦虑的感受。你内心有没有一个声音对你说，这实际上完全取决于你，你应该为这种感觉负责，或者出现问题是你的错？,9
1551,当出现问题时，您是否总是责备自己，希望自己做了不同的事情和/或挽救了这一天？,9
1552,你总是为出错的事情负责吗？,9
1553,当事情出错时，你是否总觉得是你自己的错？,9
1554,你总是把自己的不幸归咎于自己吗？,9
1555,你是否觉得在经历了一次消极的经历后，你总是对自己太苛刻，而不是把一些责任推到你无法控制的事情上？,9
1556,会不会是你总是对自己太苛刻？,9
1557,明白了，谢谢当事情出错时，你是否总是责备自己，即使这不是你的错？,9
1558,没关系，谢谢。你是否总是把情况看得太个人化，以至于你觉得对失败负责，并认为这总是你的错？,9
1559,当出现问题时，你是否总是承担责任，即使它可能根本不是你的错？,9
1560,谢谢，请注意，如果可以的话，让我们进一步探索。有时事情可能会出错或无法解决；当这种情况发生时，你是否觉得自己总是有错？,9
1561,当事情出错时，您是否总是觉得要自责？,9
1562,你是否总是倾向于为生活中的错误而责备自己？,9
1563,明白了，谢谢你是否认为，当出现问题时，你总是责怪自己？,9
1564,也许你对自己太苛刻了。当出现问题时，您是否总是发现自己有错？,9
1565,好的谢谢。你会说你最近总是在责备自己，每次出了什么问题吗？,9
1566,当事情没有按计划进行时，你总是责备自己吗？,9
1567,很抱歉，您感觉不太好，我想知道您是否为此将责任归咎于自己。你认为你总是为每一个问题责备自己吗？,9
1568,谢谢，你的情绪和感觉是有效的，我想了解更多。您是否总是觉得生活中的任何困境或问题都应该归咎于您？,9
1569,我知道了。看看你自己，你会说你总是觉得有责任感还是在出现问题时责备自己？,9

1577,你是否总是让自己为发生的任何事情负责，并为任何失败归咎于自己？,9

1581,你认为你总是对自己很苛刻吗？,9
1582,当事情不顺利时，您是否总是觉得自己将所有责任都归咎于自己？,9
1583,我只想询问您可能正在经历的任何罪责感。你是不是总觉得一切都是你的错？,9
1584,我会尽力提供更多帮助，如果你觉得没问题，因为我看到了你的痛苦。会不会是你对自己太苛刻了，出事时总是自责自责？,9

1599,我想问问你现在的思维模式，如果可以的话。一般来说，你认为自己是一个不带偏见地倾听他人意见的人吗？,10
1600,现在让我们来看看你的日常生活。当你与人交谈时，当你谈论事情时，当你发表意见时，你是否考虑过人们的不同观点？,10

2127,也许我们需要更深入地了解您的情况。如果您愿意，我们可以通过其他一些协议来工作。,20
2128,这有时会发生，但这里有更多协议可能对您更有效。你想尝试另一个，看看它是否有帮助？,20
2129,很抱歉听到你感觉更糟。您想继续并执行另一个协议吗？,20

3601,Thanks for letting me know that. Did somebody do something to you?,7
3602,Thanks for answering that. Do you feel that you are placed under undue pressure by someone?,7
3603,"Thank you, I understand. In your opinion, do you think that you blame other people for how you feel?",7

3605,Do you find yourself ever blaming other people when you feel low?,7
3606,"Do you maybe feel like a victim, do you feel like there is someone behind your anxiety?",7
3607,Could you perhaps be feeling like this because you see yourself as a victim?,7
3608,"Well in that case, I wonder if, perhaps, you feel that you rely on the approval of others too much. Do you think that your negative feelings are in part caused by others?",7
3609,"Okay, I'd be grateful if you could share some more with me. Do you perhaps see yourself as the victim? Could you be blaming someone else for how negative you feel?",7
3610,Do you think bad things are being done to you?,7
3611,I wonder if you feel that someone else's actions have made you feel like this. Do you blame others for how you feel right now?,7

3618,"Okay, this is understandable. Do you feel like someone else is the reason for you feeling this way?",7
3619,"Ok, let's explore that a little further. Do you think you might be holding others responsible for how you feel about yourself, possibly seeing yourself as a victim?",7
3620,"That's fine, thanks for answering. I'd like to ask, if you don't mind, whether you feel you're being victimized and/or that someone else is responsible for how negative you have been feeling?",7
3621,Do you feel that someone may be responsible for how you are currently feeling?,7

3623,"Is it possible that you feel that someone else's actions have made you unhappy, through no fault of your own?",7

3634,"Has someone hurt you, or worried you, and are you upset with them because they have caused you so much trouble?",7
3635,"Ok, I see. Have you felt pressured by someone else in your life, or victimised in any way?",7

3637,Could someone else be responsible for the way you are feeling?,7
3638,Do you sometimes feel that somebody else's actions are the cause of how you are feeling?,7
3639,Is there someone giving you a hard time?,7
3640,Do you find yourself always blaming others for your problems lately?,7
3641,Would you personally consider yourself affected by the moods and actions of others around you?,7
3642,Do you think that you may be trying to be in charge of someone else?,8
3643,"That's ok, thanks for letting me know. Could it be that you are the one who is trying to control others? Sometimes we might do this when we are experiencing pain ourselves.",8
3644,"Thanks, it's ok to just say no or yes, because it helps me work out your feelings more clearly. Is there a relationship in your life where you might be trying to have a little bit too much control over them?",8

3649,Do you think that you are trying to influence somebody or something outside of your control?,8
3650,Do you think that maybe you are trying to force your way on someone else?,8
3651,Thank you for that. Is someone not doing something the way you'd like?,8
3652,"Thank you. Do you, perhaps, believe that you are placing undue pressure on a person to get the results that you require?",8
3653,Do you think that in some way you may have - or trying to have - control of another person?,8

3655,Do you ever feel like you're trying to control someone else?,8
3656,Are you by any chance having any thoughts indicating that you might wish to have more control over a certain individual?,8
3657,"I can understand what is like to feel anxious, and sometimes anxiety can make us feel that someone is not acting as they should. Could it be that you are trying to control someone, without even realising it?",8
3658,Do you feel responsible for someone else in any way? Would you say you are trying to influence their life a bit too much?,8
3659,"I see, thank you, let's move on to the next question to try to get to the root of your feelings. Do you feel, perhaps, like you are trying to control someone?",8

3677,"Thank you, I understand. Are you finding yourself wanting to steer someone else's behaviour or actions in the right direction? ",8

3692,"Is there a chance that you might be always blaming yourself for things which go wrong, even if they are not necessarily your fault?",9
3693,"I see, that's good, thanks. Lately, do you always find that you are putting the blame on yourself whenever something does not go according to plan?",9
3694,"Thank you, I want to ask again about how you feel about this anxiety. Do you ever have a voice inside you that has a go at you, tells you that this is actually all down to you, that you're to blame for feeling like this or that it's your fault that something has gone wrong?",9

3701,"I see, thank you. Do you always blame yourself when something goes wrong, even if it's not your fault?",9

3720,Do you sense that you have a tendency to always blame and accuse yourself whenever something goes wrong?,9
3721,"Are you always putting yourself responsible for anything that happens, and blaming yourself for any failure?",9

4201,I'm glad the protocol was able to help. Would you like to attempt another?,19
4202,"That's really good, well done. You have an option to select another protocol to work through, if you would like to.",19
4203,"Nice, I'm really glad! Would you be willing to try another protocol as well?",19
4204,That's a good start. Would you like to continue with another of the protocols I suggested?,19
4205,Great! Do you feel like attempting another protocol?,19
4206,"Great, happy to hear that! Do you want to try another protocol?",19
4207,That is nice to hear. Would you like to try another protocol while you're feeling better?,19
4208,That's great! Would you like to try another one now?,19
4209,That's very good to hear. Would you like to continue and pick another protocol?,19
4210,That's great! Would you like to take another protocol?,19
4211,That's wonderful! Would it make you feel even better to attempt another protocol?,19
4212,Great! Would you like to also try a different one?,19
4213,I'm really glad you feel better. Maybe you're ready to try another protocol?,19
4214,Thats great. I have a couple more protocols that should help too if you are interested?,19
4215,Great. Would you like to do another one?,19
4216,I'm so glad you found this helpful and you are feeling a little better having done so. Do you think you would also benefit from another protocol?,19
4217,Do you think you would like to try another protocol?,19
4218,I'm glad the protocol has helped you. Would you like to try another protocol?,19
4219,That's great news. How about we try another one and see how we get on?,19
4220,That's great. Would you like to try an additional protocol?,19
4221,Would you like to attempt another one of the protocols?,19
4222,"Very good. As you know, there are more protocols on the list, do you think you might like to try another and see how that goes?",19
4223,"That's great, thank you for your time. Would you like to continue with another protocol?",19
4224,I'm glad that you found it useful. Would you like to try another protocol?,19
4225,Would you like to try one more protocol to see if that works as well?,19
4226,"Very well, I'm glad it is working. Shall we try another?",19
4227,"Would you be happy to do it again? If so, I can recommend a different protocol.",19
4228,Excellent! Would you like to try another protocol?,19
4229,"OK, that's great to hear. Would you like to try another?",19
4230,I am happy this session was helpful. Would you like to attempt another protocol? ,19
4231,I'm glad that you're feeling better after the last protocol. Would you like to attempt another?,19
4232,"Excellent! In that case, would you like to continue with another protocol?",19
4233,"Oh, I am really glad to hear it! Would you like to try another protocol now?",19
4234,Glad to hear that. Would you still like to try another protocol?,19
4235,I'm pleased that helped. Would you like to try another one of the protocols as well?,19
4236,"That's great news, thank you for letting me know. Would you like to try another protocol now?",19
4237,Would you like to try another protocol and see if it also makes you feel better?,19
4238,I'm sorry to hear that. Should we perhaps try another?,20
4239,"Ok, thats unfortunate, I apologise. There are many different protocols to choose from, so would you like to attempt another protocol?",20
4240,I'm very sorry to hear that. Would you like to give another protocol a try?,20
4241,"Ok, I hear how you are feeling. Could I make a different recommendation for you to try?",20
4242,"I am sorry this has not made you feel better, somtimes it may be necessary to try different protocols before feeling better. Would you like to attempt another one which hopefully will be much more helpful to you?",20
4243,"I'm sorry to hear that. There are other protocols we could try, if you would like to attempt another?",20
4244,I'm sorry you are feeling worse. Maybe we should sit down together and try another protocol that might be more beneficial to you?,20
4245,"That's not good, but we can still fix it. As you have suggested you are not feeling any better after that protocol, would you like to try a different one and see how that goes?",20
4246,I am sorry to hear that. Would you like to try a different protocol?,20
4247,I'm sorry that hasn't helped. Would you like to try another protocol?,20
4248,I'm very sorry to hear that. Would you be up to attempting another protocol?,20
4249,"Don't worry if you're feeling worse, that can happen but we can still fix it. Shall we try a different protocol and see how you feel after that?",20
4250,Would you like to try something different that might be a better fit?,20
4251,I'm sorry that this protocol wasn't able to help you. Would you like to attempt another?,20
4252,"Sorry to hear it, well done for getting through it. If you would like to try another protocol to see if this suits you better, there are other options for you.",20
4253,Would you be willing to try another protocol that might work better?,20
4254,"I'm sorry it wasn't a good fit right now, we might have to try a few ideas before we find our way. Are you ready to try another now?",20
4255,"I am sorry to hear that you feel worse. Do you feel like attempting another protocol, perhaps?",20
4256,I'm sorry to hear that. Do you want to try a different protocol to see if it works better?,20
4257,"That is not ideal, but please do not give up, it is normal that some protocols can stir up some negative feelings sometimes. Would you like to attempt another protocol at this time?",20
4258,Would you like to try again with a different one?,20
4259,"I am so sorry that it has not worked out for you, however there are other choices that I could recommend. Would you like to try another? ",20
4260,"That's completely normal to feel this way, you are not on your own with this. Would you like to try a different protocol to see if it makes you feel any better?",20
4261,I'm sorry to hear that. Would you like to attempt another protocol instead?,20
4262,I'm sorry it did not work for you. How about we try a different one?,20
4263,I'm so sorry. There may be a better protocol if you'd like to try another one?,20
4264,"That is perfectly normal, although of course I wish it had been a more positive experience for you. How about we try one more?",20
4265,"Ah, that's not good, maybe a different choice would be better. Would you like to do another one?",20
4266,"I'm sorry this exercise has made you feel worse, sometimes a different approach works better for different people. Is there another protocol you would be willing to try?",20
4267,Do you feel that you would like to look at another protocol?,20
4268,Do you think going through another protocol could help?,20
4269,"That's ok, not everyone feels better after the first one. How about we try another one and see how we get on with that one?",20
4270,I am sorry to hear you feel that way. Would you like to try another protocol?,20
4271,"Maybe we need to look deeper into your situation. We could work through some other protocol, if you like.",20
4272,"That can sometimes happen, but there are more protocols here which might work better for you. Would you like to try another and see if it helps?",20
4273,Sorry to hear you are feeling worse. Would you like to continue and do another protocol?,20
4274,There are other protocols we could try instead. Would you be open to that?,20
4275,"I'm sorry that made you feel worse. Do you feel ready to try a different protocol, which might work better for you?",20
4276,I'm sorry that hasn't helped. Shall we try another?,20
4277,"Oh, that's not good. Do you think we could try again, perhaps with a completely different protocol?",20
4278,Would you like to try a different protocol?,20
4279,"OK, don't worry, we have a few more that might work better for you. Would you like to try a different one?",20
4280,I am sorry to hear this session wasn't helpful. Would you like to attempt another protocol?,20
4281,"Not every protocol works for everyone, and that's okay, I would recommend  not giving up and trying again. Would you like to attempt another one together?",20
4282,"I see, I am sorry to hear that. Do you feel like a different protocol might help?",20
4283,"I am really sorry to hear that. I could suggest another protocol that could help, if you like.",20
4284,That's alright. Would you like to try another protocol maybe?,20
4285,"It's a shame that one didn't work for you, but we will find a protocol that does work. There are other protocols that might work better for you, do you want to try one?",20
4286,"Oh, I am very sorry to hear it, sometimes going through a protocol can bring back uncomfortable memories and I understand it can be tough. Would you like to try again with a different protocol?",20
4287,What about trying a different protocol and seeing if that makes you feel better?,20
