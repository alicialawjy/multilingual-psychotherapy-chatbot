1413,1413,Female,40-69,Anxious,Do you believe that you should be the saviour of someone else?,I understand that you are feeling anxious. Do you think that your anxiety could be a result of you trying to save someone who might not need saving?
1414,1414,Male,18-39,Anxious,Do you believe that you should be the saviour of someone else?,Perhaps you are putting too much pressure on yourself to help others. Do you think others rely on you too much?

1449,1449,Female,18-39,Anxious,"Do you see yourself as the victim, blaming someone else for how negative you feel?","I understand thank you, then perhaps we should look elsewhere for the origin of this anxiety. Would you say that someone is victimising you right now, forcing you to do something you don't want to or causing you to suffer?"
1450,1450,Male,40-69,Anxious,"Do you see yourself as the victim, blaming someone else for how negative you feel?","Thank you,  what I want to focus on now is how you feel about this anxiety. Does it ever feel like the reason you feel like this is because of what someone else has done?"
1460,1460,Female,18-39,Anxious,"Do you see yourself as the victim, blaming someone else for how negative you feel?","Thank you, I'd like to ask a follow-up question, if that's alright.

1464,1464,Male,18-39,Anxious,"Do you see yourself as the victim, blaming someone else for how negative you feel?","Well in that case, I wonder if, perhaps, you feel that you rely on the approval of others too much. Do you think that your negative feelings are in part caused by others?"

1468,1468,Male,18-39,Anxious,"Do you see yourself as the victim, blaming someone else for how negative you feel?","That's ok, thanks. Do you blame anyone for what is happening to you and do you see yourself as a victim in all this?"
1475,1475,Female,40-69,Anxious,"Do you see yourself as the victim, blaming someone else for how negative you feel?","Ok, let's explore that a little further. Do you think you might be holding others responsible for how you feel about yourself, possibly seeing yourself as a victim?"
1476,1476,Male,18-39,Anxious,"Do you see yourself as the victim, blaming someone else for how negative you feel?","That's fine, thanks for answering. I'd like to ask, if you don't mind, whether you feel you're being victimized and/or that someone else is responsible for how negative you have been feeling?"
1480,1480,Male,40-69,Anxious,"Do you see yourself as the victim, blaming someone else for how negative you feel?","OK, thanks for your answer. Do you think that your negative feelings are being caused by someone else's actions toward you?"
1481,1481,Female,40-69,Anxious,"Do you see yourself as the victim, blaming someone else for how negative you feel?",Sometimes we might feel that others are responsible for our feelings. Do you believe someone is causing your anxiety right now?
1484,1484,Male,40-69,Anxious,"Do you see yourself as the victim, blaming someone else for how negative you feel?","Could it be that perhaps you feel someone else might to be blame for your negative feelings, and this is contributing to your anxiety?"
1499,1499,Female,18-39,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"That's ok, thanks for letting me know. Could it be that you are the one who is trying to control others? Sometimes we might do this when we are experiencing pain ourselves."
1500,1500,Male,40-69,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"Thanks, it's ok to just say no or yes, because it helps me work out your feelings more clearly. Is there a relationship in your life where you might be trying to have a little bit too much control over them?"
1501,1501,Female,40-69,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"Sometimes we wish we could be there 24/7 for someone, but that can also turn into controlling behaviour. Do you think you may have displayed controlling behaviour toward someone, or tried to take over some aspect of their life?"
1508,1508,Female,40-69,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"Thank you. Do you, perhaps, believe that you are placing undue pressure on a person to get the results that you require?"
1510,1510,Female,18-39,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"I understand, thank you, I have another question I'd like to ask. Do you ever feel as though there are things or people in your life that are too unpredictable, and wish that you could have more control on them?"
1513,1513,Female,40-69,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"I can understand what is like to feel anxious, and sometimes anxiety can make us feel that someone is not acting as they should. Could it be that you are trying to control someone, without even realising it?"
1515,1515,Female,18-39,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"I see, thank you, let's move on to the next question to try to get to the root of your feelings. Do you feel, perhaps, like you are trying to control someone?"
1518,1518,Male,18-39,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"I appreciate you for opening up to me. In all this, do you see yourself trying to influence or control someone elses's actions?"
1519,1519,Female,18-39,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"I understand. Perhaps someone in your life is not behaving as you feel they should, and you may be encouraging them to change their ways?"
1525,1525,Female,40-69,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"Thank you for talking about this with me. Another possibility is that you may be trying to control someone else in order to feel less anxious, do you think this could be the case?"
1526,1526,Male,18-39,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"For one reason or another, it is quite common to want to control things or people in our life, especially when we are going through a rough patch and feel that nothing is going our way. Is there a chance that you might be trying to control someone you know?"
1527,1527,Female,18-39,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"Do you feel like maybe you are trying to control the outcome of a situation, when you should just accept the way things are and allow things to flow?"
1531,1531,Female,40-69,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,It can be hard to accept that we cannot control other people's thoughts or actions. Have you found yourself trying to control someone lately? Please rest assured that I would not judge you for it.
1534,1534,Male,40-69,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"Thank you, I would like to help you feel better, as I know anxiety is difficult. Is it possible that you are trying to control someone and could this be contributing to your feelings of great stress?"
1545,1545,Male,40-69,Anxious,Do you feel that you are trying to control someone?,"Without being intrusive, may I ask if there is someone in your life who you feel is not behaving in a way that you wish they would?"
1549,1549,Female,18-39,Anxious,Are you always blaming and accusing yourself for when something goes wrong?,"I see, that's good, thanks. Lately, do you always find that you are putting the blame on yourself whenever something does not go according to plan?"
1550,1550,Male,40-69,Anxious,Are you always blaming and accusing yourself for when something goes wrong?,"Thank you, I want to ask again about how you feel about this anxiety. Do you ever have a voice inside you that has a go at you, tells you that this is actually all down to you, that you're to blame for feeling like this or that it's your fault that something has gone wrong?"
1558,1558,Female,40-69,Anxious,Are you always blaming and accusing yourself for when something goes wrong?,"That's ok, thanks. Do you always take a situation so personally that you feel responsible for the failure and believe that it is always your fault?"
1560,1560,Female,18-39,Anxious,Are you always blaming and accusing yourself for when something goes wrong?,"Thank you, noted, let's explore further if that's ok. Sometimes things might go wrong or not work out; when this happens, do you feel as though you are always the one at fault?"
